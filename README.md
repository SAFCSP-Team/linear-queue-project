### Problem

You have a list of coffee shop orders that need to be stored, use the `queue` data structures to store the orders, and print the list of orders.

### Implementation

Write the implementation of the `queue` to store the orders of type class order.

1. Create either queue array or queue linked list.
2. Create a Node class to store the order objects.
3. Complete the Order class that has two attributes id and name.
4. In the main method, store three orders object in the queue.
3. **Dequeue** two orders.
4. Finally print the value of `front` and the value of `rear`.
