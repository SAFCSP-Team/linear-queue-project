### Problem

You have a list of coffee shop orders that need to be stored, use the `queue` data structures to store the orders, and print the list of orders.

### Implementation

Write the implemenation of the `queue` to store the orders.

1. Create either queue array or queue linked list.
2. In the main method, add the follwoing orders `["black coffe", "latte"]`.
3. Remove/`Dequeue` the two orders, then add another orders which are `["mocca", "espreso", "americano"]`
4. Finally print the value of `head` and the value of `tail`.
